## Dev Env for HealthyMe  

### Overview  
This is an application meant for general macro nutrition tracking and weight loss/gain.  

### Login/Signup  
The user is greeted with the ability to either login or signup. The only thing of note on here is the lack of user-input password.  
Instead, the user is given a computer-generated password token upon signup, then inputs that. This is a security feature, designed  
to prevent the user from accidentally encountering a password incident involving more sensitive information in other locations.  

### Application Usage  
There are only two screens after login: the primary application page and settings. The primary application page contains inputs for  
macro nutrients and weight. It also contains the expected versus real graphs. Users are allotted "levels" based on where they are  
in their respective fitness journeys. The settings page allows the user to change basic information, weight loss vs gain, and reset  
back to "Square One".  

### Potential Future Features  
Things that may get added to this application in the future include food journalling, recipe suggestions, multilingual settings, and  
changing weight gain/loss increments. The order in which they are added will come down to practicality.
